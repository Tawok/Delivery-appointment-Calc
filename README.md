"Delivery appointment" project

This project was created during a logistic transport training to calculate based on the PU time appointment, the number of hours that a truck will require 
to deliver the service to the consignee's warehouse, to set an appointment.

1. This project was created using python, and the math and DateTime libraries.
2. To obtain data from the code, you need to have "load date", "arrival date", "distance" (from point A to point B), "truck speed" and "load window time"(2h).

The code will calculate the following data:

1. Will calculate the number of hours driven by a truck from point A to point B.
2. Will calculate the number of hours driven, and taking into account the window load time (2h), the window time can be modified.
3. It will calculate the time zone in case you are in a different time zone.
